# What is the Microsoft Health Bot Service?
The Microsoft Health Bot Service makes this simple by providing an extensible and easy to use management portal that partners can use to build health bot instances with an array of healthcare-specific configuration options, out-of-the-box triage and symptom checker content, as well as easy integration with our Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) and other cognitive services.

Our partners are using the Microsoft Health Bot Service to build health bot instances that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example, insurers are using our service to build health bot instances that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services. Meanwhile, providers have built health bot instances that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

## Out-of-the-box AI and world knowledge capabilities
While each health bot instance is highly customizable and extensible, the Health Bot Service is built with a wide range of out-of-the-box features. The Health Bot Service leverages information from respected healthcare industry data sources to generate accurate and relevant responses. 

The Health Bot Service enables meaningful conversations for patients with an interactive symptom checker and uses medical content databases to answer health questions. Conversational intelligence supports layperson natural language conversations to flow and adapt dynamically as each health bot instance learns from previous interactions. The service intelligence is powered by Microsoft Cognitive Services and credible world knowledge.
