# What is the Microsoft Health Bot Service?
The Microsoft Health Bot Service makes this simple by providing an extensible and easy to use management portal that partners can use to build health bot instances with an array of healthcare-specific configuration options, out-of-the-box triage and symptom checker content, as well as easy integration with our Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) and other cognitive services.

Our partners are using the Microsoft Health Bot Service to build health bot instances that address a wide range of healthcare-specific use cases. For example, insurers are using our service to build health bot instances that give their customers an easy way to look up the status of a claim and ask questions about benefits and services. Meanwhile, providers have built health bot instances that triage patient issues with a symptom checker, help patients find appropriate care, and look up nearby doctors.

## Out-of-the-Box AI 
While each health bot instance is highly customizable and extensible, the Health Bot Service is built with a wide range of out-of-the-box features. The Health Bot Service leverages information from respected healthcare industry data sources to generate accurate and relevant responses. 

The Health Bot Service enables meaningful conversations for patients with an interactive symptom checker and uses medical content databases to answer health questions. Conversational intelligence supports layperson natural language conversations to flow and adapt dynamically as each health bot instance learns from previous interactions. The service intelligence is powered by Microsoft Cognitive Services and credible world knowledge.

## Configurable and Extensible
The Health Bot Service provides endless flexibility of use to Microsoft partners:
1) Unique scenarios can be authored by partners for their health bot instances to extend the baseline scenarios and support their own flows.

2) The health bot instance's behavior can be configured to match the partner's use cases, processes, and scenarios.

3) The health bot instance can easily be connected to partners' information systems---for example, systems that manage EMR, health information, and customer information.

4) The health bot instance can be easily integrated into other systems such as web sites, chat channels, and digital personal assistants

## Security and Privacy
The information handled by each instance of the Health Bot Service is privacy protected to HIPAA standards and secured to the highest standards for privacy and security by Microsoft. Built on top of the industry-leading Microsoft Azure technology, the Azure architecture powers the Health Bot Service's ability to scale with resilience, while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.

## Easy to manage
Each health bot instance is easily managed and monitored by Microsoft partners via the Health Bot Service's management portal and management API. The management portal provides the ability to define the health bot instance's behavior in fine detail and to monitor usage with built-in reports. Management API allows the partner to embed the health bot instance and to securely exchange data and information.
