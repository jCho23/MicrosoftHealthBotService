## Conversational Elements
From sending prompt messages to getting answers from the user to specific questions, interaction with end users is a mandatory functionality in any chat bot conversation. The Health bot provides a simple interface to allow communication with the user in scenarios and data flows.

### Prompt
Prompts are used to create two way interactions with user. An author should configure the displayed message such that it guides the user and helps to provide the expected value.

### Yes / No Prompt
The Yes/No prompt is essentially a Boolean prompt combined with a decision step. It allows the author to ask boolean questions and branch according to the answer.
